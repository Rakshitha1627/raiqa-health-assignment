This React app lets users increment/decrement a counter (not below 0), add the current counter value to a list (only if greater than 0), and reset the counter after adding. The list displays added numbers without duplicates and can be sorted in ascending or descending order via a toggle button. The highest and lowest numbers in the list are highlighted, and there is a reset button to clear the list. The UI is clean and responsive with basic styling.

To run locally, clone the repo, install dependencies (npm install or yarn install), then start the dev server (npm start or yarn start). Open http://localhost:3000 to use the app. Build for production with npm run build or yarn build.
